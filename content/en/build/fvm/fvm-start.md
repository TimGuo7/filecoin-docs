The Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) is a WASM-based virtual machine that brings compute directly to the edges of Filecoin's globally distributed storage network. FVM supports smart contracts written specifically for Filecoin, as well as smart contracts written for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), Secure EcmaScript (SES), and eBPF.

FVM is [still in development](https://fvm.filecoin.io/). Resources for early developers are currently available at https://fvm.discourse.group/.
